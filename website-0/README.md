This website was developed in Haskell using the [Twain](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/twain) library and [Lucid2](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lucid2).
To start the server, enter `cabal repl` in the project, then once in the REPL, invoke the `main` function.

Then, go to [localhost:1024](http://localhost:1024/).
